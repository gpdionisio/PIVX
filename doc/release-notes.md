PIVX Core version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).

Sapling Parameters
==================

In order to run, PIVX Core now requires two files, `sapling-output.params` and `sapling-spend.params` (with total size ~50 MB), to be saved in a specific location.

For the following packages, no action is required by the user:
- macOS release `dmg` binaries will use the params that are bundled into the .app bundle.
- Windows installer `.exe` will automatically copy the files in the proper location.
- Linux `PPA/Snap` installs will automatically copy the files in the proper location.

For the other packages, the user must save the param files in the proper location, before being able to run PIVX v5.0.0:
- macOS/Linux `tar.gz` tarballs include a bash script (`install-params.sh`) to copy the parameters in the appropriate location.
- Windows `.zip` users need to manually copy the files from the `share/pivx` folder to the `%APPDATA%\PIVXParams` directory.
- self compilers can run the script from the repository sources (`params/install-params.sh`), or copy the files directly from the `params` subdirectory.

Compatibility
==============

PIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). PIVX Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

PIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

(Developers: add your notes here as part of your pull requests whenever possible)

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument (see [PR 2317](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/2317)), which is a JSON object
  containing one or more of the following members:
  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs
  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs


#### Disable PoW mining RPC Commands

A new configure flag has been introduced to allow more granular control over weather or not the PoW mining RPC commands are compiled into the wallet. By default they are not. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--enable-mining-rpc` to the `configure` script.
